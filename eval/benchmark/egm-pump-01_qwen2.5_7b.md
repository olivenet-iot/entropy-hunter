To perform an Entropy Generation Minimization (EGM) analysis on a centrifugal cooling water pump, we will follow these steps:

1. **Total Entropy Generation Rate Calculation via Gouy-Stodola Theorem**
2. **Bejan Number with Grade Assignment**
3. **Decomposition by Mechanism (Fluid Friction vs Mechanical Losses)**
4. **Recommendations for Reduction**

### Step 1: Total Entropy Generation Rate Calculation

The Gouy-Stodola theorem is used to calculate the total entropy generation rate in a pump:

\[ \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{\Delta h - W}{T_{\text{amb}}} + \dot{m} s_f \]

Where:
- \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \) is the total entropy generation rate.
- \( \Delta h \) is the head loss per unit mass (enthalpy difference).
- \( W \) is the shaft work input to the pump.
- \( T_{\text{amb}} \) is the ambient temperature in Kelvin.
- \( \dot{m} s_f \) is the sum of entropy generated by fluid friction and other mechanisms.

#### Given Data:
- Volume flow rate (\( Q \)) = 120 m³/h = 3.333 m³/s
- Total head (\( H_{\text{pump}} \)) = 25 m
- Motor electrical power (\( P_{\text{elec}} \)) = 12 kW
- Pump hydraulic efficiency (\( \eta_{\text{hyd}} \)) = 70%
- Motor efficiency (\( \eta_m \)) = 91%
- Fluid: water at 28°C (approximately \( T_{\text{amb}} = 301 K \))
- Operating mode: full load

#### Step 1.1: Shaft Work Input to the Pump
The shaft work input to the pump is given by:

\[ W = P_{\text{elec}} / \eta_m = 12000 / 0.91 \approx 13186.8 \text{ W} \]

#### Step 1.2: Head Loss per Unit Mass (\( \Delta h \))
The head loss in the pump can be converted to enthalpy difference using the specific volume of water at 28°C (approximately \( v = 0.001003 \text{ m}^3/\text{kg} \)):

\[ \Delta h = H_{\text{pump}} \cdot g \cdot v = 25 \times 9.81 \times 0.001003 \approx 0.246 \text{ kJ/kg} \]

#### Step 1.3: Mass Flow Rate (\( \dot{m} \))
The mass flow rate can be calculated from the volume flow rate and specific volume:

\[ \dot{m} = Q / v = 3.333 / 0.001003 \approx 3324.6 \text{ kg/s} \]

#### Step 1.4: Total Entropy Generation Rate
Using the Gouy-Stodola theorem:

\[ \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{\Delta h - W / (\eta_{\text{hyd}} \cdot \dot{m})}{T_{\text{amb}}} + \dot{m} s_f \]

First, calculate the work done by the pump (net work):

\[ W_{\text{net}} = W / \eta_{\text{hyd}} = 13186.8 / 0.7 \approx 18838.29 \text{ W} \]

Then, calculate the total entropy generation rate:

\[ \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{(0.246 - 18838.29 / (3324.6))}{301} + 3324.6 s_f \]

Since \( s_f \) is not directly given, we can approximate it by considering the fluid friction and other mechanisms:

\[ \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} = \frac{(0.246 - 5.67)}{301} + 3324.6 s_f \approx -0.018 + 3324.6 s_f \]

### Step 2: Bejan Number with Grade Assignment

The Bejan number (N_s) is a dimensionless number used to quantify the ratio of irreversibilities due to heat transfer and fluid friction:

\[ N_s = \frac{\dot{S}_{\text{gen}}}{\dot{Q} / T_{\text{amb}}} \]

Where:
- \( \dot{Q} \) is the heat transfer rate.

Since no specific heat transfer data is given, we can assume that most of the irreversibilities are due to fluid friction and mechanical losses. Thus:

\[ N_s = 1 + s_f \cdot T_{\text{amb}} / (P_{\text{elec}} - W) \]

### Step 3: Decomposition by Mechanism

#### Fluid Friction Entropy Generation
The entropy generation due to fluid friction can be estimated using the Bejan number and the total entropy generation rate:

\[ s_f = N_s - 1 \]

From the previous step, we have an approximation for \( \dot{S}_{\text{gen}} \). Using this, we can estimate \( s_f \):

#### Mechanical Losses Entropy Generation
The mechanical losses are typically associated with bearing and seal friction, which can be estimated as a fraction of the total entropy generation:

\[ \dot{S}_{\text{mech}} = (1 - N_s) / T_{\text{amb}} \]

### Step 4: Recommendations for Reduction

#### Fluid Friction
- **Optimize the Pump Design**: Improve impeller geometry and blade angles to reduce fluid friction.
- **Use Lubricants with Lower Viscosity**: Reduce bearing friction.

#### Mechanical Losses
- **Improve Sealing**: Use better seal technology to minimize leakage and associated losses.
- **Lubrication Management**: Ensure proper lubrication of moving parts to reduce mechanical wear and tear.

By implementing these recommendations, the overall entropy generation rate can be minimized, leading to more efficient operation of the pump.
